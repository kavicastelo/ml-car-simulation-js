# ML Car Simulation in JavaScript

An advanced **neural network-powered car simulation** built in **pure JavaScript**, inspired by the FreeCodeCamp tutorial. No external libraries are used — everything is built from scratch.

## 🚘 Features
- Dynamic car simulation
- Road detection and obstacle avoidance
- Neural network model training using mutation
- Visual debugging and progress tracking

## 🧠 Core Concepts
- Backpropagation
- Genetic algorithms
- Real-time simulation
- Sensor-based pathfinding

## ⚙️ Requirements
Just open the `index.html` in your browser!

## 📽️ Credits
Original idea by [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs_rAxEsAvI). This is an extended implementation.
